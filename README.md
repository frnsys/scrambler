# Scrambler

I have a pretty big folder of design inspiration that's too difficult to
keep organized. Even if it were organized, I prefer browsing through it
in a stream, but it's not a fluid experience with OSX's finder.

This script will grab your inspiration folder (which you can specify
		within the script), wrangle up all the images from that folder and
its subdirectories, and dump them randomly into an HTML file for your
viewing pleasure.

To run, just do
```ruby scrambler.rb```
